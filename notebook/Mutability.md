# Mutability


## Variable Mutation
I think that variable mutation is structural mutation of the environment.
I say this because Python lets you gain access to said environment as a dictionary.
Another reason why is because when I wrote a stack-based VM I had an environment that used strings as keys and was
used to store variables for non-stack based storage.
